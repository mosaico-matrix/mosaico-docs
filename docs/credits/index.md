- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): Used to store the data in the networking module

## Why Flutter?
This is the first time I've used Flutter, and I must say I'm impressed.
The development process is smooth, hot-reload is a game-changer, the pub.dev ecosystem is rich, and the community is very active.
I've always been able to find a package that does what I need, and when I couldn't, I was able to write my own without too much hassle.

I found it really easy to create a beautiful and responsive UI, the only steep learning curve was the state management, at first I used
the standard `setState` of the `StatefulWidget` but then I switched to `Provider` and `ChangeNotifier` to keep the UI code totally separated from the business logic.
Using the `Provider` package also allowed me to move the providers I needed in both the mobile app and the IDE to the shared library, so I could reuse them in both projects without duplicating code.
